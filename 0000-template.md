## Summary

[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Explanation

[basic-explanation]: #basic-explanation

Explain the proposal in moderate detail, providing information on the proposal made
in the RFC.

## Reference

[reference]: #reference

Elaborate on how you think this idea should be implemented, including technical
details if applicable, and other relevant/related information.

## Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing
  them?
- What is the impact of doing this?

## Precedent

[precedent]: #precedent

- Does any prior precedent/do any prior examples of this exist, either within or
  outside of MAE?
- How can these examples be adapted to this issue and/or RFC?

## Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature (if
  applicable)?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and
how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use
this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the
project and language in your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the
roadmap for the project and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you
are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state
that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a
reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on
motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides
additional information.
