# Request for Comments

- Feature Name: - Feature Name: (fill me in with a unique ident,
  `my_awesome_feature`)
- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- RFC PR: [rust-lang/rfcs#0000](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/0000)

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

<!--
Include this section if and only if your RFC is technical. Otherwise, feel free to
remove.

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in MAE and you were teaching it to
another user. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how users should *think* about the feature, and how it should impact the
  way they use MAE. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.

## Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail
that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain
more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.
-->

## Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing
  them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Precedent

[precedent]: #precedent

- Does any prior precedent/do any prior examples of this exist, either within or
  outside of MAE?
- How can these examples be adapted to this issue and/or RFC?

## Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature (if
  applicable)?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?

## Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and
how it would affect the language and project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use
this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible interactions with the
project and language in your proposal. Also consider how this all fits into the
roadmap for the project and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you
are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state
that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section is not a
reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on
motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides
additional information.
